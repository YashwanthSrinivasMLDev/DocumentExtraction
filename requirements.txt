# Deep learning backend (PyTorch)
# Streamlit Cloud's containers typically come with a version of CUDA pre-installed.
# Installing a compatible CPU-only version is often safer and easier for free tiers.
# If you have a GPU instance, you'd specify the CUDA version here.
# For CPU-only, the following lines are sufficient.
torch
torchvision
